"Flinders River is well and truly over the odds at his current quote of $11. He only recorded the one race win during his maiden racing campaign, but he clearly has some ability and he has form around the likes of Blue Diamond Stakes winner Tagaloa and Holyfield. Barrier three is ideal and he maps to get a lovely run in transit with John Allen in the saddle.",Flinders River is well over the odds. He’s form is like the Blue Diamond Stakes winner Tagaloa and Holyfiled.
Grand De Flora has recorded three wins from six race starts and she is a filly with plenty of ability. She could hardly have been more impressive when she won at Ladbrokes Park last start and she ran some of the fastest closing sectionals of the day. This race really isn’t that much tougher and she can make it two wins on the trot.,Grand De Flora won three races from six race starts. She won Ladbrokes Park last start and this race isn’t much tougher.
"Shepard failed to fire at Flemington last start, but he is a much better horse than that effort suggests. His victory before that at Ballarat was very impressive and this drop in class does suit him. He can ride forward from the wide barrier and it would not surprise to see Luke Nolen turn this contest into a genuine staying battle.",Shepard is much better than what he performed at Flemington last start. He won at Ballarat before that. He performs well from the wide barrier.
Shahzade has been a touch unlucky in her past two race starts and could easily be heading into this contest on the back of four straight victories. She ran the fastest closing sectionals of the day when she finished second behind Whiskey Shooter at Ladbrokes Park last start and this race isn’t much tougher. Lachlan Neindorf will be able to settle her closer to the speed from barrier seven and she will have every possible chance to return to winning form.,"Shahzade wasn’t lucky in her past two race starts. Before that, she had four straight wins. She finished second at Ladbrokes Park last start and this race isn’t much tougher."
"Catadude has shown good ability during his two race starts to date and he has an excellent chance to claim a maiden race win this afternoon. On exposed form, he has a clear class edge over the rest of this field and he has the early speed required to overcome his wide barrier draw. Daniel Stackhouse will take him straight to the front in the early stages of this contest and he will give his rivals something to catch.",Catadude has good chance to win the maiden race. He has good early speed to overcome the wide barrier.
Bandinelli is well and truly over the odds at his current quote of $8.50. His last start victory at Geelong was impressive and he has the benefit of talented young apprentice Lachlan Neindorf in the saddle.,Bandinelli is over the odds. He won at Geelong last start. The jockey Lachlan Neindorf is a talented young apprentice.
"Hot In Paris is well and truly over the odds at her current quote of $8.50. She showed her ability when she won at Bendigo a couple of starts ago and she is a better filly than her last start effort at Mornington suggests. Dylan Dunn will settle her in the second half of the field, but she will be storming home in the concluding stages.",Hot In Paris is truly over the odds. She won at Bendigo and she is better than her last start at Mornington.
"Smokin’ Romans could hardly have been more impressive when he won by almost four lengths on debut at Ballarat and the scary thing for his rivals is that he still has the upside to improve. John Allen will be able to take him straight to the front in the early stages of this contest and if he produces anything like his last start effort, he will prove very tough to beat.",Smokin’s Romans won on debut at Ballarat. He will go straight in front in the early stages and be very tough to beat.
"I am confident that Smokin’ Hard is a better filly than her current record suggests. Her two race starts this campaign haven’t been overly impressive, but she hasn’t had a huge amount of luck in running. Barrier five is ideal for her and she is over the odds at her current price.",Smokin’s Hard wasn’t lucky this campaign. Barrier five is ideal for her and she is over the odds.
"This is a very open race and it is silly that Doogans Rise is $61. His first-up effort was poor and he is now a nine-year-old, but he showed last campaign that he still has some ability on his day. There are no stars in the field and he is a much better chance than his current odds suggest.",Doogans Rise’s price is silly. He is nine-year-old but he still has some ability. He is better chance given there is no starts in the race.
