Caulfield is one of the most famous racetracks in Australia and each spring hosts the famous Caulfield Cup. In early 2000, the Melbourne Racing Club and Victorian industry spent considerable money on improving the track, which has been a great success. The Melbourne Racing Club races 60 times per year and Caulfield is its premier racetrack. Its other circuit, Sandown, is mainly used for midweek and winter racing to preserve the Caulfield grass. The Caulfield Cup ranks among the top five races in the country and is run in mid-October each spring. Other spring features are the Caulfield Guineas for 3YO colts and the 1000 Guineas for the fillies.

If you’ve ever been to the Melbourne Cup, you'll know why people often call it ‘The Race That Stops A Nation’. It doesn’t get any bigger or better than this. The iconic annual horse race is a staple of the Australian sporting calendar. Each year, this highly anticipated event is held on the first Tuesday of November. This year, the Melbourne Cup is slated for 3pm local time on Tuesday 3rd November. The ultimate test of stamina and staying power, the Melbourne Cup is raced over a punishing distance of 3,200 metres. More gruelling than any other major event in Melbourne’s Spring Racing Carnival, the prestigious race places extraordinary demands on the contestants, and bestows exceptional glory upon the winners. In addition to the huge Australian audience that drops everything each November to follow the race, the Melbourne Cup has also captured the imaginations of countless international racing fans. With usually close to half of the field for the Melbourne Cup being raiders trained outside of Australia and New Zealand, the event has blossomed into a truly global affair. Australia does not have a reputation for breeding genuine stayers so, each year, the Melbourne Cup field features more and more internationally bred and trained horses. In recent years, international horses have dominated Melbourne Cup races. For thoroughbred racehorses, the prestigious Melbourne Cup is the world’s richest handicap. The competitive landscape has changed considerably in Australia in recent times, leaving the Melbourne Cup as one of few authentic, two-mile horse races. The Andrew Ramsden Stakes at Flemington Racecourse and the Sydney Cup in NSW are the only other 3,200 metre Group 1 races on Australian shores. Lasting for approximately three and a half minutes, the Melbourne Cup is the ultimate test of strength, speed and endurance. A Bart Cummings-trained horse called Kingston Rule famously obliterated the competition back in 1990 to set an all-time record of 3:16.30 minutes. Will that record be broken in 2020?

The Victoria Derby day, which is always held on a Saturday is the first of four days of racing that make up Melbourne Cup week with the Melbourne Cup day on the Tuesday, the VRC Oaks on the Thursday and the Seppelt Mackinnon Stakes on the final day of the carnival the following Saturday. The Victoria Derby is the toughest test for three-year-olds in Australia. The 2500m distance is a gruelling examination of stamina in a spring three-year-old so early in the season but many winners have gone on to win Caulfield and Melbourne Cups later in their careers, which makes the Victoria Derby an important race for any young stayer. The beauty of the Victoria Derby is that a horse that didn’t show enough speed to run in races like the Golden Slipper as a two-year-old can improve rapidly as a three-year-old and develop into a stayer capable of tackling the long distance. Australian and New Zealand-bred horses have shared the spoils over the years. The Victoria Derby is not a target for international horses because Australasian three-year-olds are bred the Southern Hemisphere time, meaning they turn three on August 1 while horses bred in the Northern Hemisphere turn three on January 1, meaning they are still two-year-olds at the time of the race. The Victoria Derby is one of only two Derbys in Australia run over 2500m along with the South Australian Derby. The Australian Derby in Sydney is run over 2400m as is the Queensland Derby. The Victoria Derby carries the same $2 million prizemoney as the Australian Derby, making them the richest Derbys in Australia. The Victoria Derby requires spring three-year-olds to compete at their top for about two minutes and 37 seconds, making the race a tough examination of speed, endurance and a horse’s will to win. Fiveandahalfstar ran the quickest Victoria Derby since the redevelopment of the Flemington racetrack when he clocked 2:35.92 in 2012. Will the 2020 Victoria Derby winner go faster than that?

Australia has many great horse races. The Golden Slipper is the world’s richest two-year-old race. The Doncaster is a classic mile event, while the Caulfield Cup is a staying race with a long, famous history. Then of course, there’s the ultimate staying event and the race that stops a nation: the Melbourne Cup. In more recent times, The Everest is staking it’s claim as the major sprinting race on the calendar. But of all our great races, there’s one that the purists largely agree is the ultimate: the W.S. Cox Plate. In the 2018 Cox Plate, the legendary Winx won the race for a fourth consecutive year - an achievement never been done before and unlikely to be repeated. Run at Moonee Valley each October, between the Caulfield and Melbourne Cups, the Cox Plate is a weight-for-age race over 2,040 metres. Contested by the best middle distance and staying horses in Australia (and increasingly from around the world), the weight-for-age conditions make the race a pure test of the best horse and give the race it’s enormous appeal and history. Total prizemoney for the race is now $5 million. Named after William Samuel Cox, founder of the Moonee Valley Racing Club, the race was first run in 1922, when it was won by Violoncello. The honour roll of winners reflects the race’s extraordinary history, and includes names such as Amounis (1927), Phar Lap (1930, 1931), Ajax (1938), Rising Fast (1954), Tobin Bronze (1966, 1967), Gunsynd (1972), Kingston Town (1980, 1981, 1982), Better Loosen Up (1990), Super Impose (1992), Octagonal (1995), Saintly (1996), Might And Power (1998), Sunline (1999, 2000), Northerly (2001, 2002), Makybe Diva (2005), So You Think (2009, 2010) and Winx (2015, 2016, 2017, 2018). In recent years, of course, the Cox Plate has been the biggest stage for the queen of the Australian track, Winx. Winx recently retired after 33 consecutive victories (including 25 Group 1 wins), which included an amazing four straight Cox Plates in 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018. It’s a feat never before achieved in almost 100 years of the Cox Plate. Kingston Town won three straight in 1980, 1981 and 1982, and no other horse had won more than two Cox Plates on end. Winx changed all that with her four wins, which included thumping wins by large margins in 2015 and 2016, when she was arguably at the peak of her powers. She would start favourite in all four editions of the great race, with her final win in 2018 providing one of the truly great moments in Australian racing.

The recent battle between Racing NSW and Racing Victoria have resulted in increased prizemoney for major races in both states. On July 11th, 2019, Racing Victoria announced an interesting bonus scheme for the Cox Plate to lure more horses to come to Melbourne throughout the Spring Racing Carnival. The bonus scheme is as follows: Bonus 1: Any horse that has won or wins the following Victorian feature races in 2020, and the 2020 Cox Plate will be eligible for a $1 million bonus: The All-Star Mile, Australian Guineas, Australian Cup, Alister Clark Stakes, Memsie Stakes, Makybe Diva Stakes, Feehan Stakes, Underwood Stakes, Turnbull Stakes, Toorak Handicap, Caulfield Guineas, Thousand Guineas or Caulfield Stakes. Bonus 2: Any three-year-old that completes the following will be eligible for a $1 million bonus: 1. Competes in either the Stutt Stakes, Caulfield Guineas Prelude or Thousand Guineas Prelude; and 2. Competes in either the Caulfield Guineas or Thousand Guineas; and 3. Wins the 2019 Cox Plate. This bonus prizemoney will certainly make the Spring more interesting and could see a lot more horses in Melbourne fighting it out for the extra cash. Along with the Melbourne Cup, Caulfield Cup and Golden Slipper, the Cox Plate is recognised as one of Australia’s horse racing “majors”. This makes it one of the biggest betting races on the Australian calendar! With the best horses competing at weight-for-age conditions, opinions on the outcome often vary greatly, which makes for lively betting. That however hasn’t been the case for the past couple of years… due to the champion Winx. The great mare won four consecutive Cox Plates (2015-2018) – a feat never before achieved. Her dominance has seen her go into the Cox Plate a raging hot favourite despite the presence of some highly qualified local and international competition. Naturally, this has stifled betting somewhat. Her crowning achievement, the 2018 Cox Plate, saw her jump at $1.22. She was actually shorter the year before, in 2017, starting $1.18 with bookmakers. 2016 was a slightly different story, with her starting her second Cox Plate at $1.80, odds that now seem incredibly generous! This was due in large part to the presence of Hartnell, who had put together a stellar run of form without facing the great mare. Some suspected her might be her equal… she put eight lengths between herself and field to answer that! The champion was travelling well in 2015, but nobody yet had a true idea of the heights she would reach. She did go into the 2015 Cox Plate as favourite, but she jumped at the much more attractive odds of $4.50. Again, it’s didn’t reflect the reality, as she saluted by 4.5 lengths. While everybody in racing is sad to see Winx go, it will mean more lively betting activity in races such as the Cox Plate. There’s no longer any one standout so far ahead of the rest, and punters’ opinions will shape the betting market hugely once again.

2020's Caulfield Cup is slated for Saturday 17th October at Caulfield Racecourse in Melbourne. Mark your diaries - this race is the feather in the cap of Melbourne Racing Club’s prestigious 3-day Spring Racing Carnival in October. Run over a distance of 2400 metres, under handicap conditions, the $5 million Group 1 Caulfield Cup is the most lucrative turf race of that distance, anywhere in the world. Ranking alongside the coveted Melbourne Cup in terms of prestige and popularity, the 2020 Caulfield Cup is the first leg of the spring Cup’s Double. It heralds the onset of elite racing for punters and racing enthusiasts around the nation. The 2020 Cox Plate takes place one week later at Moonee Valley, followed by the Melbourne Cup Carnival the following week at Flemington.
2020's Caufield Cup is on Saturday 17th October at Caufiled Racecourse in Melbourne. It is part of the Spring Racing Carnival. Caufield Cup run over a distance of 2400m under handicap conditions. The prizemoney is $5 million. It is the first leg of the spring Cup's Double.

The Caulfield Cup has built a reputation for hosting an impressive line-up of world-class racing talent. As the event draws near each year, racing enthusiasts wait impatiently for the announcement of the field. The Caulfield Cup field is released at approximately 10am on the Tuesday before the race on Saturday 17th October. Later that day, the barrier draw is also released, after a special function in the Melbourne CBD. Once we have analysed the barrier draw, we will share it online, so check back here on the day.

The Everest was the brain-child of Racing NSW CEO Peter V’landys and modeled off the US race the Pegasus World Cup. The concept of the race is there are 12 slot holders who each forked out $600,000 to pick their own runner to line up in the 1200 metre weight-for-age race which carries a whopping $13 million in prizemoney. The slot holders identify a horse, they then do a prizemoney split deal with the horse’s owners and trainers, sign a contract and then they’re in the game. In 2017 the race was run for the first time at Randwick and won by the Peter and Paul Snowden-trained Redzel, beating Vega Magic from the David, Ben Hayes and Tom Dabernig stable with former Japanese galloper Brave Smash, trained by Darren Weir, in third. Australian racing is regarded as the benchmark for sprinters throughout the world. With the race in its infancy, the way slot holders have negotiated with connections adds an element of intrigue. All 12 slots are currently unconfirmed for The Everest 2020 but horses can come and go so the field won’t be finalised until 7.30am on race morning. Each of the 12 starters are selected by slot holders that forked out $600,000 to buy a spot in the $13 million race. This uncertainty regarding the make up of the field makes doing form for the race tricky prior to the final field being established. The field for the race is declared once all slotholders have confirmed their runners. The barrier draw is conducted on the Tuesday prior to raceday. Once the field is finalised Racenet will provide for free, it’s comprehensive online field list and form, which is regarded as the best in the business. The horse is always the star of the show in racing and in The Everest you will see 12 of the fastest horses on the planet. Australia is widely recognised as having the best pool of sprinters in the world so with a $13 million prizemoney purse in the offering, you can expect the best to run in The Everest. The inaugural The Everest was run in 2017 and won by the 2017/18 Australian sprinter of the year Redzel. That horse also won the second version of The Everest in similar circumstances. In 2019, we had a new winner of The Everest in Yes Yes Yes, a three-year-old colt trained by Chris Waller and ridden by Glen Boss.
The Everest is billed as the "world's richest race on turf" with twelve of the fastest horses competing over a distance of 1200 metres at Randwick Racecourse for prizemoney of $13 million. The Everest will be held on Saturday, October 17, 2020 and won in 2019 by Yes Yes Yes.
14.
Flinders River is well and truly over the odds at his current quote of $11. He only recorded the one race win during his maiden racing campaign, but he clearly has some ability and he has form around the likes of Blue Diamond Stakes winner Tagaloa and Holyfield. Barrier three is ideal and he maps to get a lovely run in transit with John Allen in the saddle.
Flinders River is well over the odds. He’s form is like the Blue Diamond Stakes winner Tagaloa and Holyfiled.
15.
Grand De Flora has recorded three wins from six race starts and she is a filly with plenty of ability. She could hardly have been more impressive when she won at Ladbrokes Park last start and she ran some of the fastest closing sectionals of the day. This race really isn’t that much tougher and she can make it two wins on the trot.
Grand De Flora won three races from six race starts. She won Ladbrokes Park last start and this race isn’t much tougher.
16.
Shepard failed to fire at Flemington last start, but he is a much better horse than that effort suggests. His victory before that at Ballarat was very impressive and this drop in class does suit him. He can ride forward from the wide barrier and it would not surprise to see Luke Nolen turn this contest into a genuine staying battle.
Shepard is much better than what he performed at Flemington last start. He won at Ballarat before that. He performs well from the wide barrier.
17.
Shahzade has been a touch unlucky in her past two race starts and could easily be heading into this contest on the back of four straight victories. She ran the fastest closing sectionals of the day when she finished second behind Whiskey Shooter at Ladbrokes Park last start and this race isn’t much tougher. Lachlan Neindorf will be able to settle her closer to the speed from barrier seven and she will have every possible chance to return to winning form.
Shahzade wasn’t lucky in her past two race starts. Before that, she had four straight wins. She finished second at Ladbrokes Park last start and this race isn’t much tougher.
18.
Catadude has shown good ability during his two race starts to date and he has an excellent chance to claim a maiden race win this afternoon. On exposed form, he has a clear class edge over the rest of this field and he has the early speed required to overcome his wide barrier draw. Daniel Stackhouse will take him straight to the front in the early stages of this contest and he will give his rivals something to catch.
Catadude has good chance to win the maiden race. He has good early speed to overcome the wide barrier.
19.
Bandinelli is well and truly over the odds at his current quote of $8.50. His last start victory at Geelong was impressive and he has the benefit of talented young apprentice Lachlan Neindorf in the saddle.
Bandinelli is over the odds. He won at Geelong last start.
20.
Hot In Paris is well and truly over the odds at her current quote of $8.50. She showed her ability when she won at Bendigo a couple of starts ago and she is a better filly than her last start effort at Mornington suggests. Dylan Dunn will settle her in the second half of the field, but she will be storming home in the concluding stages.
Hot In Paris is truly over the odds. She won at Bendigo and she is better than her last start at Mornington.
21.
Smokin’ Romans could hardly have been more impressive when he won by almost four lengths on debut at Ballarat and the scary thing for his rivals is that he still has the upside to improve. John Allen will be able to take him straight to the front in the early stages of this contest and if he produces anything like his last start effort, he will prove very tough to beat.
Smokin’s Romans won on debut at Ballarat. He will go straight in front in the early stages and be very tough to beat.
22.
I am confident that Smokin’ Hard is a better filly than her current record suggests. Her two race starts this campaign haven’t been overly impressive, but she hasn’t had a huge amount of luck in running. Barrier five is ideal for her and she is over the odds at her current price.
Smokin’s Hard wasn’t lucky this campaign. Barrier five is ideal for her and she is over the odds.
23.
This is a very open race and it is silly that Doogans Rise is $61. His first-up effort was poor and he is now a nine-year-old, but he showed last campaign that he still has some ability on his day. There are no stars in the field and he is a much better chance than his current odds suggest.
Doogans Rise’s price is silly. He is nine-year-old but he still has some ability. He is better chance given there is no starts in the race.

The 2020 Winx Warwick Stakes will be held on Saturday 22nd August at Randwick Racecourse. The race was won in 2019 by Samadoubt. It didn’t take long for racing authorities to move to honour Winx, the queen of the Australian turf and one of the best mares to ever race in Australia. In 2018 – while Winx was still racing, no less – the Australian Turf Club renamed the Warwick Stakes the Winx Stakes, honouring the champion and coinciding with the race’s upgrade to Group 1 status. Prior to this however, the Warwick Stakes had a very long and prestigious history of its own. First run in 1923 at Warwick Farm Racecourse, the race was awarded Group 2 status upon Australian adoption of the group system in 1979. Though continuing to be run at Warwick Farm for most of its life, the race was sometimes held at Randwick, and was moved there permanently in 2014. The honour roll of winners reveals some of the true greats of Australian racing history. Winners since the race’s inception include names such as Limerick (1927, 1928, 1929), Amounis (1930), Chatham (1933, 1934), Flight (1944), Bernborough (1946), Tulloch (1957), Kingston Town (1980, 1981, 1982), Super Impose (1990, 1991), Sunline (1999) and, of course, Winx in 2016, 2017 and 2018.
The 2020 Winx Warwick Stakes is on Saturday 22nd August at Randwick Racecourse. It was won by Samadoubt in 2019. The Australian Turf Club renamed the Warwicks Stakes the Winx Stakes in 2018 and upgraded to Group 1 status. The first run of Warwicks Stakes was at Warwick Farm Racecourse in 1923. 
25.
The 2020 Memsie Stakes will be held on Saturday 29th August at Caulfield Racecourse. The race was won in 2019 by Scales of Justice. The Memsie Stakes’ status as an early-season “lead-up” race for the Spring Carnival somewhat belies its long and prestigious history. Consider first an honour roll of winners that stretches back to 1899 and includes names such as Artilleryman (1919), Phar Lap (1931), Ajax (1938, 1938, 1940), Comic Court (1949, 1950), Rising Fast (1956), Manikato (1982), Sunline (2000, 2001), Makybe Diva (2005), Miss Finland (2007) and So You Think (2010). An interesting mix of both sprinters and staying types make up the list of past winners, which is a product of its 1400 metre distance. Many horses have used the Memsie as their first stop in a campaign that is ultimately targeting races such as the Cox Plate, Caulfield Cup or Melbourne Cup. A prime example of this is three-time Melbourne Cup-winning champion Makybe Diva. The 2005 Memsie Stakes was the only time in Makybe Diva’s career that she won a race at less than 2000 metres – an interesting statistic for such an incredibly successful horse. The race is now run in late-August, and is worth $1 million in total prizemoney, after being promoted to Group 1 status in 2013.
The 2020 Memsie Stakes is on Saturday 29th August at Caulfield Racecourse. It was won by Scales of Justice in 2019. The race run over a distance of 1400m. Past winners are a mix of sprinters and staying types. Memsie is a first stop for horses targeting at Cox Plate, Caufield Cup or Melbourne Cup. An example is Makybe Diva who won Melbourne Cup three times. The prizemoney is $1 million. It is promoted to Group 1 status in 2013.
26.
The 2020 George Main Stakes will be held on Saturday 19th September at Randwick Racecourse. The race was won in 2019 by Avilius. The recently renamed Colgate Optic White Stakes is Group 1 mile race contested at Royal Randwick during the Sydney spring carnival. Until very recently it was known as the George Main Stakes being in dedication to former chairman of the Australian Jockey Club (AJC) George Main, who was also a prominent breeder of racehorses. It serves as the major-weight-age lead up and form reference for the Epsom Handicap which is run two weeks later over the same distance at Randwick. It was created in 1945 and was initially contested over 1400m distance for 26 years before being altered to a mile (1600m) race from 1972 onward. History reveals it takes an incredibly talented horse to win this prestigious event. Genuine WFA superstars such as Shoot Out (2012), Kingstown Town (1981-1982), More Joyous (2010) and Lonhro (2003) are among the victors of the race. The late trainer T.J Smith managed to saddle up a record 11 winners of this event during his storied career. His daughter Gai Waterhouse has 3 winners to her name and was the most successful trainer in recent history until Chris Waller passed her total due to the accomplishments of Winx, one of the greatest racehorses of all time. Winx managed to conquer this race an amazing three years in a row (2016-2018), a phenomenal record breaking achievement for the mare. She twice used this race as a launching pad for her Melbourne spring carnival assault remaining undefeated throughout both preps. Her win in the 2017 edition proved to be a phenomenal effort. Around the home turn Winx was many lengths behind and appeared to be failing to respond to the urging of jockey Hugh Bowman. Happy Clapper looked to have sprinted clear before Winx finally found her stride and powered home to win easily with a performance that set a new race record of 1:33.65.
The 2020 George Main Stakes is on Saturday 19th September at Randwick Racecourse. It was won by Avilius in 2019. It is renamed Colgate Optic White Stake recently and is Group 1 status. The racing distance was initially 1400m in 1945 and altered to 1600m in 1972. Winx won this race in three consecutive years.

The 2020 Sir Rupert Clarke Stakes will be held on Saturday 19th September at Caulfield Racecourse. The race was won in 2019 by Begood Toya Mother. The Sir Rupert Clarke Stakes, inaugurated in 1951 as the Invitation Stakes is a Group 1 open handicap run at Caulfield Racecourse. The race was first conquered by Jovial Lad. The race was renamed in 2005 after former chairman of the Victorian Amateur Turf Club, Sir Rupert Clarke who passed away in 2005. Prior to 1994, the race was held on Royal Melbourne Show Day, which was observed on the Thursday in the last full week of September as a public holiday. It remained a Principal Race until 1979 when it was upgraded Group 1 status. The race has established itself as one of the premier Group 1 sprint handicap races in the country. It regularly attracts a big field of high quality of exciting sprinters and fresh, resuming middle distances horses from around Australia. Being both a handicap and early sprint feature in the Spring calendar, it can often unearth young up-and-coming champion sprinters such as Santa Ana Lane who won the race in 2017 as an emerging talent and subsequently cemented himself as Australia’s best sprinter and a top 5 spot in the World’s Best Racehorse Rankings.

The Turnbull Stakes, held at Flemington under set weight and penalty conditions for four-year-olds and upwards, is one of the most pivotal middle distance races of the spring. It was originally run under handicap conditions (1864-1963) and then under weight-for-age conditions (1964-1970). It serves as the paramount preparatory race and guide for staying horses targeting the Caulfield Cup or the Melbourne Cup. Being a 2000 metre event, it also attracts a high number of quality middle distance specialists who are building for the Yalumba Stakes and/or the Cox Plate which are both held over the same distance. Consequently it makes a very interesting crossroad event for punters where multiple different form-lines intersect. The Turnbull Stakes has been hosted by the Victoria Racing Club since 1865 and remained a principal race until Dulcify won in 1979 when it achieved Group 2 status. It was upgraded to Group 1 in 2006 and had a brief demotion to Group 2 the next year. However, it has enjoyed Group 1 status again since 2010. Many of Australia’s best racehorses and trainers have tasted success in this event. Originally racing under various different names including the Royal Park Stakes (1865-1894), September Stakes (1895-1897), October Stakes (1898-1935) and the Melbourne Stakes (1936-1947).

One of Australia’s great three-year-old races, the Caulfield Guineas is an enormous event on the racing calendar. Run over the mile during the Victorian Spring Carnival, the race is considered one of the pre-eminent – if not the pre-eminent - three-year-old race in Australia. The prized race has been won by some of the greatest champions of the Australian turf, including many who’ve gone on to have brilliant careers at stud. The Caulfield Guineas is known as a ‘stallion-making’ race, often contested and won by the best three-year-old colts in the country, which then go on to realise enormous values as sires. Run on the first day of the Melbourne Racing Club’s Spring Carnival at Caulfield, the Caulfield Guineas is the major event on one of the most prestigious racedays in Australia. Three other Group 1 races – the Caulfield Stakes, the Toorak Handicap and the fillies-only Thousand Guineas – are also run on the day.

The Thousand Guineas, run at Caulfield during Melbourne Racing Club’s Spring Carnival, is Victoria’s premier mile race for three-year-old fillies, and one of only two such races on the Australian calendar to carry Group 1 status (the other being the Flight Stakes at Randwick, Sydney). First run in 1946, the Thousand Guineas is somewhat of a fillies-only counterpart to the Caulfield Guineas, which is run on the same day over the same distance, but with no restriction on gender. The Thousand Guineas has been shuffled around the week of the MRC Spring Carnival over the years, originally being run on Caulfield Cup day before being moved to the Wednesday prior as a standalone feature event.

Along with the AJ Moir Stakes (also at Moonee Valley, over 1000 metres) and the VRC Sprint Classic (Flemington, 1200 metres), the Manikato Stakes is a key sprinting event during the Victorian Spring Carnival. Originally a Principal race, then a Group 2 race, the event has been going since 1968 and was originally called the Freeway Stakes. In 1984, the race was renamed the Manikato Stakes after the champion that had won it twice in 1979 and 1982. Manikato also won an autumn spiriting feature at Moonee Valley, the William Reid Stakes, a remarkable five times in a row, virtually demanding that a high-level race be named in his honour. The Manikato Stakes was born, and then awarded Group 1 status in 1989. Originally run as a second Group 1 race on Cox Plate Day, in 2012 the Manikato Stakes was shifted to become the main event at the Valley on the night before the Cox Plate. Keen to extend their Carnival and offer their signature Friday night racing product at the premium time of year, the Manikato Stakes gave the Moonee Valley Racing Club the ideal race to headline the Friday night before their biggest day, the Cox Plate.

The Golden Eagle is a new race which has given an incentive for owners to resist overtures from studs and continue racing colts into their four-year-old season with a distance of 1500 metres at Rosehill Racecourse for prizemoney of $7,500,000. The Golden Eagle ran its first race in 2019 and it was won by Kolding. In 2019, it was the inaugural Golden Eagle race worth $7.5 million at Rosehill Racecourse. The name serves as an extension for four-year-olds on the brand "Golden", as it is also seen from other races such as the Golden Slipper (1200) for two-year-olds and Golden Rose (1400m) for three-year-olds. If a horse were to win the trio of "Golden' races, making it the "Golden Slam", an additional $5 million bonus will be awarded. In 2020 The Golden Eagle seems to fall on the same day as the Victoria Derby which is run in Flemington also on October 31st. The reason for the creation is due to the fact that there are no four-year-old races during the Melbourne Carnival and it is believe that the spotlight should be on both states. Of the $7.5 million prizemoney, 10 per cent will go towards charity. Each runner will nominate a charity that has been accredited with Racing NSW. Racenet is the place to keep you up to date with the latest news, updates, tips and results for The Golden Eagle Carnival.

The 2020 Coolmore Stud Stakes will be held on Saturday 31st October at Flemington Racecourse. The race was won in 2019 by Exceedance. Now one of the four Group 1 races on Victoria Derby Day, the Coolmore Stud Stakes has a very long and interesting history! Officially named the Ascot Vale Stakes, the race was first run all the way back in 1863. For over 100 years, the race was quite different to what we know it as now. It was run during the VRC’s Autumn carnival, generally on Australian Cup Day. Additionally, it was a race for two-year-olds. This was the case until 1965 when the race was placed in recess and not run again until 1969, in a guise far more familiar with the current race. The Ascot Vale Stakes was now for three-year-olds and run in the spring (usually in early September). And the race returned with a bang in a historical sense, with the 1969 edition being won by legendary colt Vain. The race evolved into its current state in 2006, when it was switched on the schedule with the Group 3 Danehill Stakes, which was moved from Derby Day to September. The Ascot Vale Stakes was given Group 1 status and shifted to Derby Day, making it the high-profile race we now know it as.

The Cantala Stakes, a Group 1 quality handicap over the mile, is a mainstay of the Melbourne Cup Carnival. The race was first run all the way back in 1881 as the Coburg Stakes, and has been through a number of name changes since – for both sponsorship and other reasons. The Cantala Stakes was traditionally the feature race on the last day of the Melbourne Cup Carnival, but in 2016 was switched to Victoria Derby Day, a week earlier. The race effectively switched places with the Mackinnon Stakes, which was moved to the final day of the carnival to improve scheduling for horses that had raced in the Cox Plate and were looking to go on to the Mackinnon.

Victoria Derby Day, arguably the best day’s racing on the Australian calendar, brings with it a number of high-quality Group 1 events. There are four in total: the Derby itself, along with the Ascot Vale Stakes, the Cantala Stakes and the Empire Rose Stakes. A relatively young race among the Melbourne Cup Carnival features, the Empire Rose Stakes was first run in 1988. The race was inaugurated for Empire Rose, the great New Zealand mare who completed a great Cup week double in 1988 by winning the Mackinnon Stakes (the run on Derby Day), followed by the Melbourne Cup on the Tuesday. It made Empire Rose the first mare to win the Melbourne Cup since Light Fingers in 1965. A popular winner, the Victoria Racing Club responded by inaugurating the Empire Rose Stakes, which has grown steadily in stature since. It was a Listed race initially, before being upgraded to Group 3 status in 1995, Group 2 in 1997 and finally Group 1 in 2004.

Like the Thousand Guineas to the Caulfield Guineas, the Oaks is effectively the sister race to the Victoria Derby, the 2,500 metre race for three-year-olds run on the first day of the Melbourne Cup Carnival. While the Victoria Derby is open to both sexes, the VRC Oaks is a fillies-only event. Along with the ATC Oaks, the VRC Oaks is Australia’s equal-richest race for three-year-old fillies, with current prizemoney of $1 million.

The 2020 Railway Stakes will be held on Saturday 21st November at Ascot Racecourse. The race was won in 2019 by Regal Power. For much of the year, Western Australian racing is left much to its own devices. The distance from the rest of Australia means horses rarely travel to and from Perth. That all changes once a year, in late November, when Perth hosts its annual carnival. The highlight of this is Western Australia’s three annual Group 1 races: the Railway Stakes, the Winterbottom Stakes and the Kingston Town Classic. Perth’s signature mile race, the Railway Stakes has been run over that distance for nearly 100 years, though it’s history actually dates back even further than that. It was first run all the way back in 1887, when it was a fixture on Perth Cup day and run over a mile and a quarter, or approximately 2,000 metres. After being reduced in distance to an even mile in 1925, the race continued as a fixture on Perth Cup day. Its distance was shortened slightly to 1,500 metres from 1972 to 1983, before it was returned to the mile, and the race was awarded Group 1 status in 1979. Scheduling-wise, the big change came in 2001 when the Western Australian Turf Club moved the race from Perth Cup day, in early January, to late November to form part of the annual Perth Carnival.

The 2020 Winterbottom Stakes will be held on Saturday 28th November at Ascot Racecourse. The race was won in 2019 by Hey Doc. While Western Australian racing is somewhat isolated for most of the calendar year, their once-a-year major carnival is a high-profile event on the national racing stage, with the eyes of the industry turning toward Perth. Western Australia’s three Group 1 events – the Railway Stakes, the Winterbottom Stakes and the Kingston Town Classic – are the signature races of the carnival. First run in 1953, the 1200-metre Winterbottom Stakes has grown steadily in stature to become Western Australia’s premier sprint race – and indeed one of the nation’s sprint highlights. Initially run over seven furlongs (or 1,400 metres), the race was reduced to the truer sprint distance of 1,200 metres in 1994, paving the way for its continued development into a major short-course race. After holding Group 2 status since 1979, the race was upgraded to Group 1 grade in 2011 and is now run on the middle weekend of the three-week Perth Racing Carnival, as a standalone Group 1 race. Additionally, total prizemoney was increased to the magical seven-figure mark - $1 million – in 2015. This ongoing improvement of the race has seen it become a target for many star sprinters on the national stage, reflected by some of the recent winners, which include Miss Andretti (2005), Takeover Target (2008), Ortensia (2009, 2011) and Buffering (2013, 2015).
The 2020 Winterbottom Stakes is on Saturday 28th November at Ascot Racecourse. It was won by Hey Doc in 2019.

The 2020 Kingstown Town Classic will be held on Saturday 5th December at Ascot Racecourse. The race was won in 2019 by Kay Cee. The Kingston Town Classic is one of the major races of the annual Perth Racing Carnival in late November, the highlight of the Western Australian racing calendar. Once a year, the usually isolated Western Australian racing scene draws the attention of the nation as it hosts the state’s three Group 1 races: the Kingston Town Classic, along with the Railway Stakes and the Winterbottom Stakes. An 1,800 metre weight-for-age event, the Kingston Town Classic is now the closing highlight for Perth’s annual racing carnival and is named after Kingston Town, who won the race in 1982. Kingston Town is a legendary name in Australian racing, having won three straight Cox Plates (1980 – 1982) among many other career achievements. Despite the race first being run in 1976, the name wasn’t inaugurated until 2007.

The race continued to be run over the next decade, variously at Moonee Valley and Flemington, before moving more permanently to Caulfield in 1949, Sandown in 1966, and then back to Caulfield in 1997. Through a series of club mergers through the years, the Williamstown Racing Club became part of the Melbourne Racing Club, now based at Caulfield Racecourse.

It’s known as the Black Caviar Lightning these days, but the Lightning Stakes has been around since 1955. Run down the famous Flemington straight over 1000 metres (or the old equivalent, five furlongs), the Lightning is a super high-speed test of Australia’s best sprinters. In 2013, the new race name was adopted to honour the great Black Caviar, considered by many to be the greatest sprinter in Australian history. Black Caviar raced 25 times for 25 wins, including three wins in the Lightning Stakes (2011, 2012 and 2013). The 1000m Black Caviar Lightning is the first of the three big Group 1 sprint events over the Melbourne autumn racing carnival. The Oakleigh Plate (1100 metres) at Caulfield follows the Lightning, with the Newmarket Handicap (1200 metres) back at Flemington after the Oakleigh Plate. Black Caviar is the only horse to have won the race three times, but a number of Australia’s great sprinters have won the Lightning twice. The dual winners are Sky High (1961 and 1962), Wenona Girl (1963 and 1964), Maybe Mahal (1977 and 1978), River Rough (1984 and 1985), Schillaci (1992 and 1993) and Mahogany (1995 and 1997).
